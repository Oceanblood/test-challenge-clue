# Test automation challenge

Welcome to the test automation challenge!

We know you are busy, so we don't expect you to invest a long time in solving this. This is designed to be a short, but open-ended challenge. We trust you to timebox it, and do as much as you can in a few hours (we suggest a maximum of 4 hours), in order to show your amazing skills!

If something isn’t clear, just send us an email with your questions, just like you would do if this was a real day-to-day assignment. We want you to succeed as much as you do, so don't worry if you have a question!


## Instructions

![app](images/app.gif)

* Download and inspect the open-sourced android application from the current repo
* Design a test suite for the sign-up and login functionality
* Build an infrastructure for test case implementation
* Implement your test cases

## Grading
With this task we would like to get an idea of how you would approach automation. There is no “correct” solution to this task.

The challenge will be evaluated on:
* The reasoning behind the framework and pattern you've selected
* The quality of the solution, rather than the quantity of automated tests
* Vision and future proofing - the potential of your solution to be expanded, and your description of where you would take it.
* Your coding style
* Your usage of git (we encourage you to keep .git history :) )
* Documentation, including possible improvements or different approaches

## Expected deliverables

* Working automated test suite on provided android build
* README.md file describing your tools, assumptions, solutions and next possible steps to develop this solution more robust

We mainly want to see how you think, the reasoning behind the tools you selected, including potential drawbacks and advantages, so the more you can back up your ideas with strong arguments, the better. We are conscious of your time. It's fine if you need to skimp on some aspects to save time - mention your decisions in your README. The aim is to get an idea of your coding style and level, as well as how you go about creating an automation framework.


And lastly, have fun with it! Good luck!
